    <h2> Description</h2> 
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul class="lists"> 
        <li> <strong> Chicken: </strong> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li> <strong> Seasonings: </strong> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder. </li>
        <li>  </strong> Butter: </strong> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to. </li>
        <li> </strong> Celery: </strong> Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol class="lists">
        <li> Season the chicken inside and out. </li>
